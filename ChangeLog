	Modified the CUTE_INCLUDE_DIR to be just include/ and not include/CUTE/

	Took out the ./configure, might not be needed with cmake.

2019-04-10  Kodi Neumiller  <kneumiller@mtech.edu>

	syntax fixes. May need to add boost, not sure

2019-04-09  Kodi Neumiller  <kneumiller@mtech.edu>

	Added cute to the deps (and travis_deps). Did NOT add stare to the deps, but it should be able to be made manually running "make stare". May still need some tweaking.

	Added the CUTE.tar.gz. Modified the Makefile to install CUTE and to update and use the correct version of STARE

	Explain how this project works..

	Added a target for Travis builds

2015-06-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the Makefile so that hdf4 and hdf5 use -w with the compiler
	This will suppress warnings which, in turn, may help this build pass
	on travis... We'll see.

	Added comments to Makefile and modified travis.yml

2015-06-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added travis.yml

2015-05-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified build to support static libs
	This means that the deps build correct static (.a) libraries so that
	the modules can link to them and not require odd bits of code from
	EPEL. Of course, we can make the server's modules using only deps from
	the RPMs and from this code using shared libs, too.

2015-05-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/hyrax-dependencies

	Bumped the version of the dist to 1.11.1

	Added bison 3

2015-04-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The hdf4 install no longer include the broken ncdump/ncgen programs
	These were being picked up by configure and were then used for
	tests in fileout_netcdf. They don't appear to handle signed integers
	correctly, causing false fails in the tests. I talked to Kent Yang
	@THG and he said they were not for general use.

2015-04-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 1.11

2015-04-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a new target for linux and static linking.
	This builds all of the handler deps code that cannot be found in the
	default RHEL/CentOS 6 repos. If the CONFIGURE_FLAGS shell variable is
	set to --disable-shared, the libraries will be static and a BES rpm
	will thus not need any special repos for the netcdf, ..., packages.

2015-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Made a special target for the rpm build.
	The hdfeos2, gdal, gidfields and fits CentOS 6 RPMs are either missing
	altogether or are too old for Hyrax 1.10. So, build them here for use
	with a 'special' rpm made for NASA's use. Anyone can use this, but it
	was made for NASA.

2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Better targer name for rpm-only deps

	Added an option: Build only the stuff we cannot get from RPM.
	This can be used with the new NASA RPM package thingy I'm working
	on.

2014-12-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added gitignore.

2014-11-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added empty dir 'src'; updated Makefile for deps 1.9.5

	Replaced apache tomcat 7.0.29 with 7.0.57
	Why? Because the latter works with Java 8.

2014-11-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Copied our 'dependencies' project to git. This may not be a great idea, but we'll see how it works out..
