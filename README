Short version: To build the dependencies for the BES handlers used
with Hyrax, run 'make' in this directory. The Makefile assumes that
the environment variable 'prefix' has been set and points to the root
of the directory where you are building Hyrax (it does not have to be,
but that's the assumption). The Makefile will compile, test and install
all of the dependencies in $prefix/deps. 

To use these dependecies with the complete BES build, use the --with-dependencies=
option with its configure script like this:

       ./configure [other options] --with-depdendencies=$prefix/deps

Note that most people who build Hyrax from source will want to set the
prefix to a specific directory, so that option would be included as
well (--prefix=$prefix), and the PATH environment variable should
nominally be set to $prefix/bin.

Notes

GDAL and OpenJPEG libraires updated to 2.1.1 (each, coincidentally,
has the smae version number). jhrg 8.24.16

I have updated a number of the libraries. jhrg 6/3/16

I modified the Makefile so that the dependency libraries, etc., are 
installed in $prefix/deps and not $prefix/deps/<package>-<version> so
that the module build can be told to look in one place and/or the system
default locations. 11/11/14

The Gridfields library SVN repo is at
https://gridfields.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/clib. Do not use the code
in our SVN repo. jhrg 3/28/14

Note: I started a Makefile - just a plain Makefile, not automake - and
have checked it in. It's not complete, but shows another way to build
these dependent/third-party packages. jhrg 11/6/12
