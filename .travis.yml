# NB: Since the STARE library is part of our research work, include it in the 'travis'
# deps build and in the C7 version of the static deps. Don't include it in the C6 deps
# build since C++-11 is not part of C6 by default. We're leaving STARE out of the Debian
# package build for now as well. jhrg 10/28/19

# I removed CentOS 6 from our packages (10/27/20) since it is going to stop having
# maintenance releases in November 2020. jhrg

# I removed the Ubuntu/deb build because we're not using it. jhrg 12/08/20
