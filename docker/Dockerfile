# Build a container that can compile the hyrax-dependencies, libdap4 and BES 
# github repos. This is designed to work with Travis CI and will need to have some 
# volumes mounted for input and output and then a script run to perform the build.
#
# Build the docker container using
# docker build -t <catchy name> .
#
# The 'docker run' command would look something like:
#  docker run --volume $HOME/install/centos6:/home/install
#  --volume $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR:/home/hyrax-dependencies 
#  opendap/centos6_hyrax_builder /home/hyrax-dependencies/build-for-rpm.sh
#
# Where $HOME/install is the value of prefix for the Travis CI build of
# hyrax-dependencies, etc., and  $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR has the cloned hyrax-dependencies repo
#
# Then push the docker container up to the docker hub
#  docker login [use opendap's creds]
#  ocker tag centos6_hyrax_builder opendap/centos6_hyrax_builder:x.y
#  docker push opendap/centos6_hyrax_builder:x.y
#
# Use an official CentOS6 or 7 runtime as a parent image (centos:centos6
# or centos:centos7)
