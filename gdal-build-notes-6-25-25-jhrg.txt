Build sqlite3 and proj first, then cmake as below works, but with a
warning that CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not set. It should be "Release".

Building sqlite3 and proj from source was a non-starter. On Rocky9, I
usd yum for both, leaving them installed in the 'standard'
locations. That is, I installed libsqlite3x, libsqlite3x-devel, proj,
and proj-devel.

The versions of the main packages are:
Name         : proj
Version      : 8.2.0
Release      : 1.el9

Name         : libsqlite3x
Version      : 20071018
Release      : 31.el9

Here's how I ran cmake:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix/deps -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
 -DGDAL_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS=OFF  -DOGR_BUILD_OPTIONAL_DRIVERS=OFF \
 -DGDAL_USE_HDF4=OFF -DGDAL_USE_HDF5=OFF -DGDAL_USE_NETCDF=OFF \
 ..
